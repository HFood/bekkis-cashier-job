# Bekki's Cashier Job decompilation
 - A full decompilation of salty_kvas' new game ["Bekki's Cashier Job"](https://saltykvasss.itch.io/bekkis-cashier-job).
 - I am not affiliated with salty_kvas in any way.
 - The decompilation has no extra objects, scripts or rooms added, its a unmodified version of the game.
 
# Notes
I recommend checking out the actual game before using the decomp, its a decent-ish game but it felt like it was pretty much just, work,-the-game.
For me, it lacks some stuff that would give the game some personality like the Papa's Series from Flipline.

# Requirements
- [Gamemaker 2023.8](https://gms.yoyogames.com/ReleaseNotes.html)
- Knowledge on how to code in GML.
